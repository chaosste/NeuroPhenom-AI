## About

High-fidelity clinical interface for mapping pre-reflective subjective experience. The conversational AI is trained in granular microphenomenology interview techniques, on altered states of consciousness in particular. Codify and theme your subject data alongside NeuroPhenom AI's granular LLM engine. Analyse the micro-dynamics of lived moments through diachronic slicing and structural synthesis.

Featuring a stark black-and-white minimalist design, the interface stays out of the way and lets the phenomenological work take centre stage.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Live Interview Sessions** — AI-guided microphenomenology interviews in real time
- 🎤 **Standalone Recorder** — Capture audio independently of the interview system
- 📊 **Analysis View** — Review and codify interview data with AI assistance
- 🔬 **Diachronic Slicing** — Temporal decomposition of experiential moments
- 🧩 **Structural Synthesis** — Map the architecture of subjective states
- ✅ **Consent Protocols** — Built-in consent management for ethical research practice
- 💾 **Local Storage** — Interviews saved locally for data sovereignty
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — Language, voice gender, and interview mode settings
- 🖤 **Minimalist Design** — Clean black/white aesthetic focused on the work
