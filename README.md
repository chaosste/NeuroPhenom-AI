## About

NeuroPhenom AI is a professional neurophenomenology platform combining micro-phenomenology interview techniques with Google Gemini AI. It provides a complete environment for conducting, recording, and analyzing first-person accounts of subjective experience — mapping the micro-dynamics that traditional methods often miss.

Featuring a stark black-and-white minimalist design, the interface stays out of the way and lets the phenomenological work take centre stage.

## Key Features

- **Live Interview Sessions** — AI-guided micro-phenomenology interviews in real time
- **Standalone Recorder** — Capture audio independently of the interview system
- **Analysis View** — Review and codify interview data with AI assistance
- **Configurable Settings** — Language, voice gender, and interview mode preferences
- **Minimalist Design** — Clean black/white aesthetic focused on the work
- **Codification System** — Systematic categorization of experiential structures
